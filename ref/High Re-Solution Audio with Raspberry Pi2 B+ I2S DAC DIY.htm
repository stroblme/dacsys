<h1>Let's try to use Raspberry Pi B+ Pi2 Pi3 for Audio source ,flac,DSD HiReso Audio DAC DIY</h1>
<br>
<h3>But "Dont see big Dream with Raspberry Pi 2 ,this is one of Toy Arm MPU board</h3>
<h3>Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi family  are ,impossible run with Windows 10 even Linux with X</h3>
<h4>Almost Toy and not PC ...much better use Intel Atom or x86 with Linux or Windows but ,,,this is small system is
only can use Linux for Arm.
<br> But Not for Linux x86 x11 .
<br>Actually Arm Linux are not Native Linux Smart phone too, just family of Linux and have to use x86 Linux 
<br>right now we can buy Pi  Zero. actually Pi Zero A + but I think much better for hand held Music server 
<br>Note:in Japan any one can not buy only Pi-Zero,Pi-Zero-W PC board.so price is more than USD $ 30.Market of Japan is funny.

<h3>And Debut   Pi Zero W  USD $ 10 (Wifi and Bluethoooth),But Arm6 </h3>
<h4>
<br>RPi 3 is now available 2016 end of Feb, USD $39.　they said 10 times more high speed than RP2 B Type.
<br>and has Bluetooth so consumption power is 2.5A.
<br>Raspberry Pi Foundation is why still do not use Intel Processor ? ARM is Kind of TOY as you know.
<br>Wifi and Bluetooth Model is can not sale in Japan, I think in USA too under FCC license .Rap Foundation hold FCC ? 
<br>so many country can not sale ... one thing ,, Raspberry Pi are until Pi2. even Pi3 is kind of TOY PC. not value to buy.
<br>Problem of Lazy Arm Processor..Do not buy bad performance of Product
 any more.Pi3 can not install native Windows 10, Windows 7,8 ?
<br>Answer is never.only Linux for Arm. Linux for Arm does not install WINE. so only element of small server system or Robot .
<br>nothing special .
<br>there are kind of TOY. if would like to buy as PC ,,much better buy MOUSE PC.or <a href="http://wildtame.co.jp/project/intel-edison-lab" target="links">Intel Edison</a>
<br>much better PC is <a herf="http://jisakupc-technical.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1510110204.jpg" target="links">AM1I-A mother Board</a>
<br>C/P is Very Best.and very low cost.if buy Pi3 Arm ,I will buy <a href="https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AM1IA/" target="links">AM1I-A PC still expensive for one of pocket money.</a>
<br>And Powerfull new PC is<a href="http://www.udoo.org/udoo-x86/" target="links">Call it's UDOO x86</a>This is supported x86 ,Lunux ,Windows Made by Intel and Best C/P.	
<br>do not buy any more Raspberry Pi 3 ~ ,enough to buy until Pi2 or 
B+.Raspberry Pi is stop because only Arm is very slow.you can use for 
very small system.
<br>and now you can use new system from Udoo.one thing very good for 
Audio because has SPDIF out and any thing can do ,you would like to use 
.......even can use as Work Station.
<br>so you can watch Internet TV too.is not kind of Toy any more.

<h3>Introduce Raspberry Pi</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>But Raspberry Pi is good for Small Music Server in your house </h1> 
<br>
<br>
<h4>BB(Ti) PCM5102A I2S DAC LSI can play from 32Khz to 358 Khz of PCM 
sound and DSF into DoP (PCM), DSD Music can play as DoP (PCM) of all 
Music.easy to configure 
<br>and easily to build up D.I.Y and sound is quite good.you can get high end sound from your small gear.
<br><font color="#ff0000">Recommend to USE ES9018 family DAC and ES9023 DAC for DoP,DSD play</font>one thing important ..Raspberry Pi I2S DAC can not play 24,32bit 
<br>Sound.is this only problem of Raspberry Pi Music Server.??????? Kind
 of Toy ?????? 16bit Player no Hireso....???????big question ..I 
have.now 1st Mar 2016.
<br>I do not have ES9018 DAC so I can not get correct answer...if 
PCM5102a I2S DAC Using 16bit sound either indicated DSD, 24 bit 48 
Khz.etc.

<h3>Inside of Volumio ,USB means HDD on USB(SATA= 1 Tera)just connected USB Port on Rasp +B</h3>
<br>
<h4>Black box is 1 Tera HDD = hook up with Raspberry Pi B+ USB Port.USB 
HDD is SATA inside of Black box. Black box is one of adapter of SATA to 
USB.
<br>not expensive,around USD $20 you can buy PC local shop.SATA is 2.5 
inch 1 tera HDD(about USD$ 50 ). off course necessary power supply of 
5V(small one for smart phone)can be use.
<br>and with USB HUB for connected with Raspberry Pi B+ and USB HDD.
<br>there are small Music Station in room. not difficults.can be use as small NAS with Raspberry Pi B+. any one can do.

<h4>Note:on 18th Mar 2016...The Jazz Groove was replace protocol so from yesterday can not catch correctly webradio under volumio.
<br>I am doing ask to The Groove Jazz Station ,,very good station but 
can not catch now.from them...very sad....but you can get playlist from 
site 
<br>then source can get here<a href="http://www.radiosure.com/" target="links">then can get information of URL</a>
<br>The Groove Jazz can replace for moment from $wget 
http://www.single-ended.com/rasp/archive/webradio/WEBRADIO.tar.gz for 
Volumio so you can install into volumio.
<br>and later I got mail from the Groove Jazz/ Mr Paul G and gave me 
next link http://thejazzgroove.com/listen/thejazzgroove-west-mp3-128.pls
 for replace but only Volumio does not play.
<br>can play from $ xine http://thejazzgroove.com/listen/thejazzgroove-west-mp3-128.pls . but under mpd could not play with volumio.
<br>thank you Paul ... any way can play my edited file are $wget

<h4>Why still are you using,, high end audio equipments and they are 
super expensive,,,but Raspberry Pi B+ can be use for Music server and
<br>Reproduce high quality of sound like flac, Wav and DSD Audio(Diff 
and DSX convert DoP PCM) through if do you have good DAC much 
better.even Raspbeery Pi can
<br>do PCM5142/5102A  BB high end DAC until 384Khz 32Bit sound, made by small PCB.not expensive.

<h4>Still I need good PC for ripping and have to buy source from 
internet(online). if do you have Good DAC probably reproduce good sound 
from Raspberry Pi B+ Music 
<br>server.Raspberry Pi B+ is very small PCB actually small PC for kids in UK.but for Audiophile can be use for Music source.
<br>how much cost ? only around USD $ 30 dollars and micro SD memory, 
and connection cables. if would like big capacity of memory , you can 
use USB SATA HDD of few Tera Byte.
<br>I am using one(1 Tera)byte of USB HDD and 2 of NAS. 2 of NAS are 
using old PC. old PC located corner of room etc.only need one PC for 
work station.
<br>even can be use control by Wifi smartphone. what is Music server and
 Music server using Linux OS. distrobution 2 of them  are famous 
.Volumio and RuneAudio.
<br>please try to use Raspberry Pi B+ in your audio room.
<br>OS where get from ?  
<br>one thing Raspberry Pi does not have master clock for I2S (The 
Inter-IC Sound Bus)DAC without general DAC so must be made Master clock 
,, idea have some mulifier IC using and will be get master clock from
<br>Bck which is using NB3N2302,　PI6C4511WE-ND　,ICS570,  LTC1799　so some day I will try hookup my DAC　with Raspberry Pi B+..
<br>
<br>PCM5102a Single DAC is very nice sound to getting. please try to 
build up.less than USD $ 15 dollars cost if do you build up by your 
self.
<br>
<br>If easy to get master clock ,,,,not difficult connect any DAC with Raspberry pi with I2C and I2S .so what can I do to..........
<br>this is my home work right now.
<br>
<br>
<br>Feb 2015 ,,,Now we can get 900 Mhz 4 core Raspberry pi P2 ,,,,and in
 future MS will be support with Windows 10 ...what's will be....

Quality sound passing trough 
<br>to your DAC or I2S type DIY DAC into your sound system. please try to build up PCM5102a small DAC. sound is good.!!!!!
<br>Note: Often does not get sound from DAC ,probably got damages LSI 
DAC then replaced PCM5 xxxx IC fixed,so what's meaning OUT PUT line of 
DAC have to connect
<br>coupling capacitor then hook up some resistance like 47K ohm respect
 ground for load.then feed to Maim Amplifier or Pre Amplifier much 
better to use.
<br>Note: Micro-SD flash memory must choose "Class 10".you can use any 
Micro SD but slow.so please use Class 10.a little bit high cost than 
regular Micro SD.
<br>if Do you have Windows PC for install Linux into Raspberry PI need 2 of applications for help.
<br>A) format application.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Micro SD Format<a href="https://www.sdcard.org/index.html" target="links">Micro SD</a>Formatter application from SD Association
<br>B) image installer....&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Win32Disk Imager <a href="https://osdn.jp/projects/sfnet_win32diskimager/releases/" target="links">Imager File Site</a>to show
<br>You need 2 application for to get OS and install image to micro SD for Raspberry PI.
<br>so not difficult.even If do you have Linux workstation or Linux 
Terminal ,you can format and install by command line.as you know.

Mhz.POT is 3K ohms .sound is a little bit more clear and getting a 
little bit more bass.but some time get

<br>
<h4>Show you 3rd party Volumio 1.55  modificated by Mr Horliy ,circuit 
is show above.GPIO 4(Pin 7 is GPIO 4) connected direct with SLCK of 
PCM5142.
<br>a little bit has noise.but not so bad.
<br>I can use any DAC without Master clock. Maste Clock came from 
Raspberry Pi B+ with his archive ,Volumio 1.55 horly version. using 
internal clock for 
<br>remote control clock. please try it. Mr Holriy 's Archives<a href="http://horliy.seri.gr.jp/Volumi155-150514.lzh">3rd Party Volumio 1.55 with Master Clock </a>
<br>works quite good. sound is very clear too please try to use...recommend.
<br>
<br>
<br>so what to do,,,, still I am getting noise from with Master Clock 
.....master clock have to make sync with internal signal of DAC.many 
case use LRclock or Bit Clock.
<br>then ,,, I made order multiple IC like ICS570 or ICS512 for will be get synclonize master clock. with use any DAC.
</h4>
<h4>So 、I got 2 of ICS512 $4 dollars each in Japan.to get 3.072 Mhz 
signal from BCK into crystal pin as pin1、S0,S1 are pull up ,connected 
directly Vcc  Multipulier works as X 8.
<br>Volumio 1.51 how was work....does not get any noise .works fine.so I
 will make some slave DAC with Raspberry Pi,.PCM1794 or FN1242A ,PCM1716
 etc.because I do not any
<br>stock in my parts box.plays quite good with PCM5142.muy bien,,,,
<br>still if do you have some noise please check RCA cable .good cable need.
<br>will show you pictures.(2nd May 2015)

<br><h10>how to access raspberry pi with out monitor</h10>
<br>my case ....  I am using Fedora Core Linux long time. so my case is ,,using by terminal from  comand line.
<br>$ arp 
<br>you can get IP on terminal ...so find Raspberry pi IP in your 
house(LAN).if does not have Linux terminal please try to use any OS 
terminal
<br>from any OS. teraterm is very famous in Japan for MS Windows.
<br>so let's try to access from other PC.  
<br>$ ssh root@192.168.1.5
<br>then if did you connect with Raspberry Pi they ask pass word so just strike key pass word "Volumio" 
<br>you can get login into Raspberry Pi ... so try to re write script of
 driver. editor is emacs ,long time using emacs so much easily than
<br>any editor for me. you can use vi ,nano etc. have to learn "how to use Linux with comand line" first.
<br>that's all.
<br>
<br>About ssh.. in general ,ssh can access from other 
Linux(Unix)terminal under terminal(xterm,kterm,gnome-terminal etc) if 
one's using MS windows.
<br>can be use teraterm , putty .for English much better use putty for 
telenet.putty is just like same as Linux terminal if you are using 
Windows please
<br>make down load <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" target="links">for PUTTY</a> can use same as Linux terminal under ssh.
<br>so does not need HDMI monitor.

<h5>How to set up FIX IP (Static)</h5>
<br>
<h4>In general, these kind of Music Server ,PC at home are using DHCP. automatically set up IP. but Often can not connect Home LAN.
<br>so much better use fixed IP. like 192.168.1.8   etc.first search 
your Modem IP .if IP of Modem is 192.168.1.1 can setup fix IP for each 
Music Server.
<br>Volumio Case is  as root or $ sudo cd /etc/network/  then edit 
interfacs of file by editer like vi, emacs and nano. which do you like.
<br>you can see $ cat /etc/network/interfaces    like next frase/   so 
if you know IP of modem in your house. please edit correct IP.
<br>gateway is your modem IP  and address is Raspberry Pi Volumio 's 
IP.which ever you like.then $ sudo reboot.you can connect LAN 
automatically.
<br>much more good for Music Server.if moved place of server. never lost again.next file is located  /etc/network/interfaces .
<br>
<br>auto lo
<br>iface lo inet loopback
<br>
<br>
<br>auto eth0
<br>iface eth0 inet static
<br>address 192.168.1.5
<br>netmask 255.255.255.0
<br>gateway 192.168.1.1
<br>nameserver 192.168.1.1
<br>
<br>
</h4><h5>How is sound from Raspberry Pi B+ with DAC PCM5142 </h5>
<br>
<h3>Does not have any noise from LAN and even "Breath-in phenomenon" now
 .ICS512 is good for use Master Clock.slightly more bright sound getting
 now.</h3>
<h4> Volumio 1.55 with Raspberry PiB+ can do play DSF ,DFF file until 
2.8Mhz but sound is not Native either can play DSD file.sound is good 
enough with volumio 1.55

<h5> how to add WEBRADIO Stations. more than 50 Stations good.from Volumio repositry </h5>
<br>
<br>
<h4>This case is add a lot of stations from Volumio repository source.from ssh comand line through on line. 
<br>first access by SSH with some terminal like xterm ,mate-terminal, 
putty for windowa and teraterm for windows.etc my case is ,Volumio's IP 
is 192.168.1.6 
<br>then open terminal from other PC. 
<br>#ssh root@192.168.1.6          
<br>#passwd  volumio
<br><font color="#ff0000">#cd /var/lib/mpd/music/WEBRADIO</font>
<br>#apt-get install git
<br>#git clone https://github.com/jprjr/internet-radio-streams.git
<br>#cd internet-radio-streams
<br>#./make_links /var/lib/mpd/music/WEBRADIO/ pls
<br>#./make_links /var/lib/mpd/music/WEBRADIO/ m3u
<br>
<br>that's all, you can get more than 50 Radio Station for InterNet.<a href="https://volumio.org/forum/add-ton-webradio-streams-volumio-t1705.html" target="links">Reff Site</a>
<br>and、if do you have Cantata,can add many Internet Radio,Cloud etc by 
GUI from other PC(Windows,MAC,Linux etc)and easy to supervise your Music
 .
<br>Note***: This version is for Volumio 1.4 so can not make correctly 
install each directly of stations holder.but you can get install .pls 
into WEBRADIO.
<br>if does not like ,pls files have to move each holder.with command of
 Linux(Unix),problem is made only empty holder.and does not get m3u 
files.many be some BUG.
<br>and if use #git clone http: ~ instead of https ,much more station 
will be get.forum does not indicated change position of command.so you 
can try #pwd
<br>you can know where stay command line... then #cd 
/var/lib/mpd/music/WEBRADIO   then please try install pls and m3u 
files.will be get more than 50 stations good music.
<br>much more fun.!!!
<br>if does not function #apt-get install git please try to update as 
#apt-get update then #apt-get install git probably get good result.
<br>this archive is inside of my volumio's WEBRADIO List's<a href="http://single-ended.com/rasp/archive/Radio-List.tar.gz">TAR.GZ files can see inside </a>if would like to use.
<br>even can down load by $wget http://www.single-ended.com/rasp/archive/Radio-List.tar.gz  on terminal of Linux.

<h3>Web Radio Stations List on Volumio　,Added from Volumio.org more than 50 Stations. </h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h5>WEBRADIO of Volumio's radio station are, some of stations are does not play....how to fix and add new stations</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Because ,,IP is different with original site of stations so please 
check IP address then replace IP or URL came from Music.or check 
Shoutcast Site.
<br>SHOUTCast<a href="http://www.shoutcast.com/" target="links"><img src="High%20Re-Solution%20Audio%20with%20Raspberry%20Pi2%20B+%20I2S%20DAC%20DIY_files/shoutcast.jpg" alt="Shout Cast" width="227" height="65"></a>then check each site then get pls .m3U files.which do you like.
<br>much better use SSH by other PC then save WEBRADIO on Volumio.、when 
down load files always files are"tunein-station.pls" so please replace 
name of file then
<br>copy into Volumio WEBRADIO directly.so easy to get many station which do you like.
<br>then Access by SSH Volumio.
<br>#cd /tmp    
<br>then   
<br>#wget http://www.single-ended.com/rasp/archive/WEBRADIO.tar.gz 
<br>  
<br>#tar xvzf WEBRADIO.tar.gz -C /var/lib/mpd/music/ 
<br> 
<br>#rm WEBRADIO.tar.gz 
<br>#cd 
<br>#pwd
<br>#reboot 
<br>you can get more than 2000 stations 、have a fun. !!! make sure ,,, much better get original files from SHOUTCast.Radiomy
<br>WGBH Boston of Classic 's quality is good.volumio indicated 24bit 48Khz ans sound is very pure and clear.include WEBRADIO.tar.gz
<br>also located WEBRADIO.zip same directly of my site.if would like to use zip file too.off curse have to use unzip.

<h3>Add WEB Radio Stations into Volumio  </h3>
<br>

<br>
<h4>above list show by other Linux PC's file manager using and see 
inside of volumio.using samba.off course can do cut out some of file and
 add files too.
<br>not necessary to use command line ssh.but only can see inside of directly of samba(share)</h4>
<br>
<h5>How to remove(delete)play list on WEBRADIO in Volumio</h5>
<br>
<h4>This is not only Volumio. because Volumio is Linux so please use 
command of Linux(UNIX),# rm xxxxxxxxx.pls which ever abcdef.mp3 etc.. 
are one of file name 
<br>#rm abcdef.mp3    that's all. you can remove one file which 
indicated. either if you have some file manager like on Main PC then you
 can see and delete by mouse.
<br>simple way is access volumio by ssh by other terminal.then delete file.which would like to delete.please see 2 of picture.

<h4>So you can easy to build up I2S DAC less than 30 dollars ,box you 
can use any kind of box. chocolete box...candy box etc but much better 
use metal box.
<br>simple circuit but will be get high reso sound from Raspberry Pi B+ 
.flac,Wav, mp3 , any kind of archive of sound.until 358 Khz 32bit.
<br>you can get from Digikey and RS components any where of local shop.very much simple circuit but will be get High Reso sound.
<br>one thing very impotant,,, winter season some problem getting, one 
of problem is broken LSI , sometime.I think cause of does not have 
coupling capacitor.
<br>so does not get sound from I2S DAC, replaced LSI then getting sound.
 please be careful to use  around outside of audio out put circuit.

<h5>How to record Music from WebRadio Stations on Volumio</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h4>First , make access by ssh raspberry pi server(Volumio) and install application for recode music
<br>then on command line change position using keyboard.
<br>#apt-get install streamripper
<br>then , try to make  #streamripper  then something to get script ?  means OK.
<br>then 
<br>#cd /var/lib/mpd/music/RAMPLAY 
<br>#mkdir mysong         ---&gt; this part is any name you can write. 
which ever save-music etc.this case use "mysong"can make any name you 
like.
<br>#cd mysong
<br>#streamripper http://listen.radionomy.com/smoothjazz247
<br>right now you can record some music from stream.but must be write 
correct URL after #streamripper  please use carefully because RAMPLAY 
does not have much memory.
<br>you can play music some day if recoded. next show photos.Music must 
be save in USB memory much better.#Cont + C can stop recoder on Volumio .
<br>one thing ,,smoothjazz247 can listen music all country. only USA and by smartphone app.any way can recode.

<h5>How is Raspberry Pi 2 EL14 ?</h5>
<br>
<h4>6 Times rapid than Raspberry Pi B+ ..... ?  last week I bought one 
of brand new one of P2 but,,,actually I do not think does not get much 
speed than B+.
<br>I think ,,,, lie........ please wait buy new Raspberry Pi 2 ,,,,,,, I
 am using 3 year old Sony Vaio with Fedora Core 18 ,,,50 times rapid 
than Raspberry Pi 2.
<br>I think Windows 10 can not function... with Rasp Pi 2........ What 
will be ? where going to Raspberry Pi 2 ?    but depend on correct 
window manager make it fast.
<br>I did try watch Hulu but still just like toy PC. we have to wait Windows 10 for Raspbery Pi 2 ????
<br> 
</h4>
<h5>Fedora 21 Remix install ----on 8th Mar 2015</h5>
<br>
<h4>Actually I do not like Ubuntu(Debian)family of Linux ,,,either I am using Fedora Core 18 Linux on my Vaio VPCJ2 working fine.
<br>just would like to install Fedora into my Raspberry Pi 2 Btype .so I did get archive from <a href="http://www.digitaldreamtime.co.uk/images/Fidora/21/" target="links">Fedora core Remix 21</a>
<br>each version of window manager need around 10 G byte of micro SD. 
original archive is around less than 1 Giga byte but necessary install 
on micro SD of around at least 32 G Byte.
<br>first I got xz file from Digital Dream Time UK site. they has 4 type and see detail on Site.
<br>please try to install ,,, then if does not make log in. please try 
on command line as Cont + Alt + F2 can do command line, as root and 
passwd is fidora.
<br>then make user # adduser name-of-handle  then # passwd name-of-handle 
<br>then # reboot you can do grafical login .if would like to upgrade 
please try #yum update and #yum ugrade.for up grade of Fedora Rimix.
<br>Fedora Core Linux is much faster than Debian and Ubuntu Linux I 
knew.using until Windows 10 brand new.Wrote 8th Mar 2015 I am so sorry 
bad english to wrote.!!!
<br>I think ,,,,Raspberry Pi 2 is weak.100 % does not work Windows 10.
<br>
<br>One thing Raspberry Pi does not have hard time clock so can not adjust time so some time need adjust like
<br># timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Tokyo  in my case...in Tokyo Japan... so your country is other thing.
<br>please install # yum install ntp  too....
<br>
<br>Other thing,,,<a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.os.freebsd.devel.arm/9836" target="links">FreeNAS</a>for Raspberry Pi can as NAS.how about...

<br>
<br>
<br>$ ssh of Volumio 2 is
<br>just show you next figure. 
<br>$ ssh volumio@your IP    then Passwd is "volumio".
<br>very much stable to use.I am using under line of IPv6 line but 
nothing problem .a month ago moved new place and this place using IPv6 
and Ipv4 both of
<br>protcol.almost one month does not play good and had been problem so replaced Volumio2.right now no problem to use.

<h3>Ubuntu Mate Version for RP2 Expand micro USB to 32 G Byte,,　7th June 2015</h3>
<br>
<h4>N01 : in general using 16 G, 32 G byte micro SD memory but always 
need memory .original partation is very small. fill up soon his micro SD
 memory.
<br>so expand up to 29 G byte. actually moved /usr and /var are moved 
into other sector of memory. not difficult and this part can use as NAS 
too.
<br>
<br>No2 :Formal way ：
<br>choose to root ,by some terminal from comand line su or sudo then
<br><font color="#ff0000">#fdisk /dev/mmcblk0</font>
<br>then delete 2nd part of line like
<br>Command (m for help): p 
<br>
<br>Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
<br>/dev/mmcblk0p1            8192      122879       57344    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
<br><font color="#ff0000">/dev/mmcblk0p2          122880     3788799     1832960   83  Linux</font>
<br>delete red line then n for make one expand sector.
<br>
<br>Command (m for help):
<br>Command (m for help): d
<br>Partition number (1-4): 2 
<br>
<br>Command (m for help): n
<br>Partition type:
<br>p   primary (1 primary, 0 extended, 3 free)
<br>e   extended
<br>Select (default p): p
<br>Partition number (1-4, default 2):
<br>Using default value 2
<br>First sector (2048-15351807, default 2048): 122880
<br>Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (122880-15351807, default 15351807):
<br>Using default value 15351807
<br>------------------------------------------------
<br>each value is depend on case of memory.this case is 8 gByte of micro USB using.
<br> 
<br>Command (m for help): w
<br>The partition table has been altered!
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Then ,,# reboot and check how to got partation .
<br>very important comand is 
<br><font color="#ff0000">#resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2</font>
<br>above comand meke realize expand Partition of memory on maicro SD.
<br>if choose final of sector ,,will be use unitl end of memory.if do 
you have 32 G byte can be use until end of memory like 29G byte.
<br>please try it's.good for you small your PC Raspberry Pi2 with 
Linux.if does not get expand partition will you try to reboot then make
<br>#resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2 again then reboot , check again with $ df 
-h can to see partition. this way to expand partition use very carefully
 to do.

<h5>Easy Way to Expand ReSize Memory</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h4>If are you using Fedora Core or Ubunti family(Debian),please try to install "gparted"
<br>$ sudo apt-get install gparted  or $ sudo dnf install gparted 
<br>then su or sudo 
<br>start gparted
<br>you can see "resize"  on /dev/mmcblk0p4 
<br>moves resize to end of memory on  which means if are you using 32 G Micro SD, Linux OS using around 4 G Byte so still you have
<br>28 G byte on Micro SD.end of memory is /dev/mmcblk0p4 as a "/ " so 
this partation will be move to final of sector.untill 28 G byte.
<br>then  
<br>#resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p4
<br># reboot
<br>you can get more memory on Raspberry Pi Linux OS.this is one case of
 Fedora Core 25 on Raspberry Pi.any way easy to expand memory.

<h3>Gparted ,easy to expand memory of Raspberry Pi Linux OS this is for Fedora Core 22 Linux</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h4><font color="#ff0000">Now you can</font>use space of memory as NAS mount volumio menu which is libraly.
<br>first must be edit /etc/samba/smb.conf  show next
<br> 
<br>[Share]
<br>
<br>  comment = Share
<br>  path = /var/samba/share
<br>  read only = no
<br>  public = yes
<br>  follow symlinks = yes
<br>  wide links = yes
<br>  
<br>this parts are use as samba directly.after mounted as NAS and IP is same as Volumio's IP.
<br>then you can use around 25 Gbyte as internal memory for keep Music.Volumio can see as NAS.it's enough Music server.
<br>can keep around 500 music of flac.even a couple of DSD Native archive.how about ? I think good idea.!!!

<h3>show small headphone amp for Raspberry Pi I2S </h3>
<h4>This time use internal power supply of +3.2V and -3.2V from Raspberry Pi B+ at PCM5102A or PCM51XX family DAC. .
<br>if possible to get +7V and -7V power supply.	much better to get good sound.
<br>but if can you get LTC1144C switched capacitor IC can get +5V and -5V power supply from internal Raspberry Pi B+ from USB +5V.
<br>if would like to use Negative Voltage at pin 5 of PCM5102A ,please use BP (bipolar capacitor nichicon BP etc)but often use 
<br>2 capacitor connected series one of up side down like figure.2 of 100uF 16V = 50uF 32V instead of one BP. why ?
<br>when out of lock music .pin5 will be get 3.2V then changes to -3.2V when came signal from server. so need BP capacitor.
<br>make sure ..please BP capacitor for safe.
<br>finally use as buffer for Headphone amplifier.but effect is very 
much great.circuit is very simple and getting good sound from hiend 
headphone.
<br><font color="#ff0000">Even</font>budget headphone singing very nice from this part.this buffer for high impedance to low for Headphone impedance.
<br>and you can use any OP IC.if does not have same IC,you can use any 
IC like 4580 etc but no connected negative power supply just connected 
ground pin 4
<br>OP IC.if can you get same audio buffer MUSES8832 can connected with Negative voltages.

<br>I have to install Volumio 1.55 again. please do not make easy to thinking " update or upgrade " after one year use.
<br>Volumio 1.55 is best than Volumio 2 .because Volumio 2 does not play DSF DSD file. still not on 16th Oct 2016.
<br>and Client MPD does not have volumu control.so from Cliant MPD can not control sound.how about ?? :)Volumio 2 is unstable.
<br>WEBRADIO is not listed in Volumio 2. get from http://api.dirble.com/
 ~ so if does not connected Internet can not get any Radio Station.
<br>this is not kind of Linux Debian.is small version of

<br>papagayo is depend on user directly.if your name is bob may be /home/bob/.icewm
<br>if User Name is pi ,/home/pi/.icewm  so on .
<br>then you can get useful "ICEWM" .ICEWM is most light weight Window Manager for Linux.
<br>please try.

<br>if start up ICEWM at home directly automatically made .icewm 
<br>this is only empty directly so above files copy into .icewm
<br>then you can use many of themes of ICEWM . so show you some of themes exsample next.any one can do ICEWM and very light weight.
<br>if does not have .icewm please make directly 
<br>$ mkdir .icewm 
<br>almost set up ICEWM is preferences and menu files must edit.using nano, emacs ,gedit etc etc.

<br>I did many thing,, but nothing to make . only one thing Volumio2 can
 accept Samba Share. Volumio2 is something different than Volumio 1.55
<br>now samba not use "Share" of word.one was problem is do not use "Share".
<br>so idea get  smb.conf from my Main Linux work Station.just some copy of them.

just made before....with volumio2.show before.later I will inform 
here.please cut out plastic case of pi. be cause does not fit
when using HDMI general connector.show just like photo.practically does 
not need monitor for Volumio2. but if has some kind of
problem with under Linux function so need monitor for watch comand line 
of without X Linux.if has problem does not make solution
of problem  by ssh. just need Keyboard, mouse and monitor. I2C DAC is 
more stable but difficult get crystal so using I2S DAC.left justfi
<br>much better.and any kind of DAC may use but problem is crysatal.if 
using this kind of DAC DIY can get good Music Server less than USD $50.

list of WEB Radio and recorded Music Files from other Music Server on 
Internal home LAN. old Volumio 1.55 + Rasp B+ MusicServer
has USB HDD and hold more than 2000 Music and  more than 2000 webradio 
stations saved.the information saved on the hard drive is automatically 
organized 
and orfanizad by each category. This wonderful. to say.....this is 
Volumio 2 3.23 2017 when if make a click "Genre", just try it's. 
<br>Pi-Zero does not work fine with Volumio2 4-21 .but PI2  working very fine but Dop does not work.some diff files work fine. 
<br>
<br>Note：can not log in by ssh volumio2 it's means can not accept passwd .please try to use like next
<br>$ ssh root@192.168.1.X -l volumio
this problem is with same LAN line has same kind of other volumio server.

<h5>How to clean up PCB (Print Circuit Board)</h5>
<br>
<h4>I do not know the exact name of the resist solution to clean the 
substrate, but when I was in Sony 45 years ago, 
I purchased the following resist solution with a resist solution like 
Matsuya (Matsuyani Pine Resin) at a pharmacy, To make a resist solution 
and clean the substrate. 
I think that it is good to produce liquids of various densities. 
Purchase solder suction wires outside the shielded wire and copper wire,
 soak in resist liquid,
 dry it in the sun. Please refer to the image. Easy! It is! It is! If 
you need a lot, I will do it like this.
  Let's keep it in a plastic bag with a small chuck because the solder 
suction line "catch a cold". 
 If you do not use the solder suction line purchased at the store as 
well,
 I think that it is better to put it in a plastic bag. If you catch a 
cold (oxidize), sucking of the solder worsens.

<h3>Volumio 2.185-2017-06-03-pi.img very nice connectivity  and using pi2, does not need big capa of uSD,sound is good</h3>
<h3>But does not make access by ssh in this version ???</h3>
<br>
<h4>So 6/3 ver and 6/13 ver both of Volumio 2 are ,can not make access by ssh.and NAS can not read server name. so can not use.
<br>so back to 5/16 version of Volumio2 .I am waiting next update.DSF 5.6 Mhz is good.But .....
<br>Note: from 1.9xxxx version ssh is desable they said for security.so what to do ? so have to use <a href="http://updates.volumio.org/pi/volumio/2.185/volumio-2.185-2017-06-03-pi.img.zip">Volumio-2.185-2017-6-03.zip</a>
<br>when if you can not use "Latist version of Volumio2".
<br>
<br>then ,,connected HDMI monitor and keyboard , mouse then start up command line....
<br>$ sudo apt-get update
<br>$ sudo apt-get raspi-config 
raspi-config is needed and setup SSH then "Enable" OK  then reboot.
<br>that's all nothing to do more then I connected by ssh from other PC.
 if you can not make access from other PC(Linux) try to delete .ssh file
<br>$ rm -R .ssh (But can not make connect NAS and USB etc ...)some thing problem with raspi-config .
<br>then access by ssh. 
and can log in by ssh -l root volumio.local　
<br>Volumio 2.201-2017-06-13-pi.img is
<br>This version of Volumio 2.2xxx can not read(indicate just shown "-")
 DSD file name and many file name could not read file name.even japanese
 file name too,
<br>Have to back to Volumio 2.185-2017-06-03-pi.img  to get fine.if would like to update ,,must be careful.

<h3>Tinker Board is twice of speed of Pi3 "They Say". <a href="https://www.asus.com/uk/Single-Board-Computer/Tinker-Board/" target="links">By ASUS</a></h3>
<h4>ASUS said much better than low spec of x86. but I think does not 
exist low spec x86. Arm is Arm and ASUS TinkerBoard does not have many 
future.
<br>just like Pi3. Pi3 is possible by use 64bit , but ASUS can not use 
64bit. if use old karnel and old x86 PC using Linux about speed is much 
better than ASUS.

<h3>very smallest server  ,you can build up and inexpensive :) if would like see click above picture</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h4>I do not know which is good but using 64bit processor.both of Cortex A53 64bit.pine64 is very similar one board PC of Pi3.
<br>Nanopi Neo2 can connected ssh and USB port.Cortex A53 64bit is using,Raspberry pi3,Think board and Pine64.what's will be
<br>Raspberry pi3 and pi2 are very much flexisible for experimenter's and DIY'er.because has many port.many information.
<br>Raspberry Pi Foundation if would like to ,will be make new product as Raspberry Pi 4  ,,must be support 1000 M LAN and Wifi,BL
<br><font color="#ff0000"> Pine64 is just like piece of Junk" </font> please do not buy.cost down product means something bad and bad support.
<br>and Memory is more than 2 G Byte.add kind of Rock Processor. we like Raspberry Pi so ,,what to do ? We like raspberry pi.
<br>By Raspberry pi Foundation　I would like you to manufacture Raspberry Pi 4 even better. 
<br>I think that it is funny that one user has Raspberry Pi as well. But Pi3 is Best performance ...Pine64 is bad quality.
<br>if one's would like to buy one of them please wait until Raspberry pi 4 much better.
<br>But new type of One Board PC has SPDIF out put and Master Clock so probably good for Music Server using minimal system.

<h4>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2490.76 Safari/537.36  Pine64 is working as
<br>x86 Machine.show above from log,so Android is some kind of x11 
x86_64bit .but actually very very slowly.impossible to watch Netflix and
<br>any kind of movie by Pine64 2 G...finally I have to use some kind of Music server.off course can use from SPDIF and I2C DAC.
<br>
<br>on 7th Sep 2017 : back from work ,Pi B+ was down ,very hot around 3.3V Regurator,so suppose be Pi B+ was broken,if CPU is good 
<br>I will try to replace 3.3V regurator.on Pi B+.be careful hot in the 
summer does not have heat sink or fan around Pi.I have 3 of them
<br>one of 3 Music server was down.have to use Pine64 for Volumio2 A.S.A.P.
<br>finally Raspberry pi B+ was broken so  Next photo is Pine64 +2G and Volumio2.using DDC and DAC.
<br>recently PC are going move system of 32bit to 64bit PC.why ? cause 
of problem of MR Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie and Mr Kenneth Lane Thompson
<br>who invented UNIX. and must know problem of 2038 . we say " problem 
of 2038 " how to Avoidance　from 2038 problem.even windows, iphone any
<br>PC are working under UNIX right now.who are great MR Dennis 
MacAlistair Ritchie and Mr Kenneth Lane Thompson in the world ,,,you 
must know.
<br>
<br>Very important note: Do not buy Pine64 and Pine64 family.because not
 compatible with raspberry pi.even they has port of PI2 40pins 
<br>but not enable.and  does not get any information .I said Do Not Buy 
 and Pine64 and Pine Family are "Garbage."because they does not give any
 information hardware by software.
